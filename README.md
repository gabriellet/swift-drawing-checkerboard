# swift-drawing-checkerboard
Draws a terribly garish red, blue and green checkerboard in a Swift 3 playground.

A few Swift playgrounds are in this repository. 

`CoreGraphicsExperiments.playground`
This draws a grid with dots periodically on the gridlines. This is from a tutorial I found [here](https://madebymany.com/blog/exploring-swift-with-playgrounds) and translated to the Swift 3 equivalent to get used to using CoreGraphics for complex shapes.

`Checkerboard.playground`
This draws said terribly garish red, blue and green checkerboard. Uses loops.

`Matrix.playground`
An attempt to parameterize which squares are filled in using an array of which positions should be filled. Allows for more complex pattern than just a checkerboard.

`Matrix2.playground`
Allows grid to be filled in from a larger matrix by scaling down to grid size (if whole number multiple). Replaces garish color scheme with a possibly equally as garish blue and yellow one.
